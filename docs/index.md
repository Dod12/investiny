# 🤏🏻 `investpy` but made tiny

Suuuuuuuper simple and tiny `investpy` replacement while I try to fix it! Here I'll try
to add more or less the same functionality that was developed for `investpy` while keeping this
package tiny and up-to-date, as some solutions just work temporarily.

Everyone using `investiny` please go thank @ramakrishnamekala129 for proposing this solution
that seems to be stable and working fine so far (fingers crossed!).

Remember that `investiny` shouldn't be considered reliable, as even though it's working fine, 
it may be discontinued, so please use it mindfully.
